### Introduction
This exploratory analysis investigates how economic conditions (rice prices), poverty indicators (like toilet access), and demographic behavior (child dependency, family size) have evolved in Rajshahi Division, Bangladesh between 1991 and 2011.

This project is deeply meaningful to me because in Bangladesh, rice is more than just a staple—it’s a symbol of survival and security for millions of families. When rice prices rise, the consequences go far beyond the dinner table. For low-income households, it can trigger a chain of difficult decisions: Should a family bring in more members to share living costs? Should children be pulled from school to help with work? Can a family still afford basic needs like sanitation?

These questions aren’t just hypothetical—they are real trade-offs that shape how households evolve over time.

I was especially interested in how economic stress, like food price shocks, might influence family structures and dependency patterns. Do families expand or contract during these times? Does poverty amplify these effects? Are urban and rural households impacted differently?

By analyzing household microdata from 1991, 2001, and 2011, and combining it with contextual indicators like rice price and sanitation access, I aimed to uncover the invisible ways economic conditions shape family life. Through this lens, Rajshahi Division stood out—a region where poverty persists, prices have fluctuated significantly, and urban-rural contrasts are pronounced.

This project is my attempt to connect economic data to human stories, and contribute to conversations around food security, demographic vulnerability, and structural inequality in Bangladesh.



***Motivation:***
This research explores how child dependency ratios vary across time, regions (urban vs. rural), and contextual factors like rice prices, family size, and access to sanitation in the Rajshahi Division of Bangladesh. This is a descriptive study, focused on quantifying observable relationships — not inferring causality.

Child dependency is an important proxy for economic strain and demographic pressure. Understanding its relationship with local food prices and living conditions helps policymakers better target interventions around family welfare and poverty alleviation.

I chose descriptive regression analysis because the questions are exploratory and relational, rather than causal or predictive in nature.


***Methods:***
We run the following Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions using the Rajshahi upazila-level dataset we built in the earlier steps.



### Monthly Rice Price Seasonality

The chart below illustrates how average rice prices vary month by month across all years. This helps us understand the predictable seasonal pricing patterns within the rice market in Rajshahi and provides insight into supply and demand cycles.


```{r fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Desktop/ECNS_560_REDO/Plots/monthly_rice_seasonality.png")
```

***Interpretation: Rice Price Seasonality in Bangladesh:***
This line graph shows how the average rice price (in BDT) changes throughout the year, based on monthly data aggregated across all years in your dataset. It reveals a clear seasonal pattern in rice pricing, likely tied to the agricultural calendar and market dynamics.

* Peaks and High Prices
February marks the highest average rice price, peaking above 640 BDT.

- Prices also rise again in August, and gradually through November and December, indicating secondary periods of increased cost.

- These peaks may align with lean seasons, when harvested rice is less available and demand exceeds supply, especially before new crops are brought to market.

* Troughs and Low Prices
The lowest prices occur in May, dropping below 500 BDT.

The sharp decline from February to May suggests increased availability of rice, likely due to Boro harvest season, which is one of the largest rice harvests in Bangladesh.

Prices begin recovering from June onward, likely as stored supply depletes and before the next major harvest arrives.

* Possible Explanations
- Agricultural cycles — Prices fall after harvests and rise before them.

- Supply increases — May's low prices may be driven by high market availability.

- Pre-harvest scarcity — February and August peaks could reflect low supply before harvests, or stockpiling behaviors.

- Festive or seasonal demand — Cultural events may also influence temporary spikes.



***Seasonal Rice Price Patterns and the Role of Boro Rice:***
Rice prices in Bangladesh follow a seasonal cycle, shaped by three harvests: Aus, Aman, and Boro. Among them, Boro rice has the biggest impact on prices because it accounts for over half of national production.

Boro is grown in the dry season (planted Dec–Jan, harvested Apr–May) using irrigation. When the Boro harvest arrives (April–May), rice floods the market, leading to a sharp drop in prices — especially in May.


As stocks deplete over the following months, prices begin rising again, peaking in August (before Aman harvest) and again in February (before the next Boro harvest). These peaks reflect low supply and high demand during lean seasons.




*** Summary:***
This seasonal trend in rice pricing has real implications for rural livelihoods, household food security, and market interventions. Policymakers might consider price stabilization strategies or targeted support during high-price months, especially for vulnerable populations.




Now, how does the economic shift impact family structure, especially child dependency (number of children per working-age adult)?

- This plot helps test whether higher rice prices (less poverty) are also linked with lower child dependency—and whether that trend differs in urban vs rural areas.





```{r fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Desktop/ECNS_560_REDO/Plots/child_dependency_vs_rice_price.png")
```

Interpretation: Child Dependency vs. Rice Price (Urban vs. Rural)
This plot shows how child dependency (i.e., the number of children relative to working-age adults) changes with the average price of rice, and how this relationship differs between urban and rural areas in the Rajshahi Division.

* What we see:
Each point represents a combination of rice price and child dependency for either a rural or urban setting.

Two trend lines — one for rural (red) and one for urban (teal) — show how child dependency shifts as rice prices change.


It suggests:
* Rural Areas:
As rice prices increase, child dependency tends to decrease.

This downward slope implies that higher rice prices may be linked to lower poverty in rural areas.

Since many rural households grow and sell rice, higher rice prices may improve their income, making it easier to support fewer dependents per adult.

* Urban Areas:
The urban trend line is fairly flat, suggesting that rice price changes don’t significantly affect child dependency in urban settings.

Urban families are typically rice consumers, not producers. So rising prices might strain household budgets, but this doesn't appear to translate into changes in family structure or dependency.



# After exploring how child dependency varies with rice price across urban and rural areas, we now go a step further.

- The earlier plot helped us see a broad trend: higher rice prices (a potential sign of economic strength for rural producers) were associated with slightly lower child dependency ratios — particularly in rural settings.

But rice price isn’t the only marker of poverty or economic vulnerability.


To better understand the spatial context of our earlier findings, the map below visualizes poverty rates across all upazilas in Bangladesh, with bold borders around Rajshahi and Dhaka divisions for comparison.

While this study focuses on Rajshahi, including Dhaka allows for a clearer contrast between one of the country’s major urbanized hubs and a more agriculturally driven division. Rajshahi shows significant intra-regional variation in poverty, with several upazilas experiencing poverty rates far above the national average. This spatial disparity reinforces the importance of analyzing child dependency and poverty not only by economic indicators like rice price, but also by geographic and administrative divisions.

```

*Figure: Poverty rates by upazila, with Rajshahi and Dhaka divisions highlighted*

Color scale (bottom right):

Yellow = lower poverty

Purple = higher poverty

Gray = missing or unmatched data



Poverty in Dhaka Division
The highlighted black-bordered area represents Dhaka Division, now visually distinct from the rest of the country.

Compared to other regions:

Dhaka Division shows moderate-to-lower poverty rates, especially around urban/upazila centers near Dhaka city.

Some surrounding upazilas in Dhaka Division still show intermediate levels of poverty (orange/purple hues), indicating urban-rural disparity within the division.Urban Dhaka and surrounding upazilas show better conditions than rural areas.

Regional comparison:

Southwest (Barisal) and parts of the northwest show higher poverty (lots of purple).

Central regions like Dhaka, and pockets of Chattogram and Sylhet, appear less impoverished overall.




- Some upazilas are shaded in light gray on the map, indicating missing poverty data. This occurs when a geographic region in the shapefile does not have a corresponding poverty value in the data. The mismatch is likely due to naming inconsistencies or missing records in the original dataset. It is important to interpret these areas with caution, as the absence of data does not necessarily imply lower or higher poverty — it simply reflects a data gap.

# After examining regional poverty across Bangladesh, we now zoom in to Rajshahi Division to highlight internal disparities. The following map labels the top 5 poorest and top 5 least-poor upazilas in Rajshahi, offering a granular view of where the division’s poverty burden is most concentrated.

These contrasts emphasize that even within a single division, poverty is not evenly distributed — some upazilas face significantly worse deprivation than others. This local variability is crucial for understanding the structural conditions behind child dependency, household vulnerability, and access to basic services.

```

*Figure: Rajshahi’s top 5 and bottom 5 upazilas by poverty rate*

Top & Bottom 5 Upazilas by Poverty Rate (Rajshahi Division)

This shows the spatial distribution of poverty rates across upazilas within Rajshahi Division of Bangladesh.

***Regional Insights:***

* Top 5 Upazilas (highest poverty) — labeled in pink:
1. godagari

2. shahjadpur

3. chatmohar

4. bera

5. belkuchi

These areas are shaded darker on the map (higher poverty), and labeled in pink, indicating they fall in the top 5 poorest in Rajshahi Division.

* Bottom 5 Upazilas (lowest poverty) — labeled in blue/purple:
1. chupchanchia

2. adamdighi

3. kahaloo

4. rani nagar

5. shajahanpur

These are found in the northern and north-central part of the map and are shaded yellow to orange, reflecting lower poverty rates.

***Interpretation:***
There is a spatial gradient in poverty across Rajshahi Division.

Northern upazilas like chupchanchia and kahaloo have significantly lower poverty rates.

Southern and western upazilas, such as bera and godagari, face higher poverty.

This may reflect differences in:

- Urbanization

- Economic activity (e.g., agriculture, remittances)

- Access to services (education, healthcare)




The previous map highlighted how poverty is unevenly distributed across upazilas in Rajshahi Division — with some areas facing significantly worse deprivation than others.

But poverty doesn't exist in isolation. It interacts with family structure, economic context, and basic service access. The next plot brings those dimensions together, showing how child dependency varies not just by rice price, but also by poverty levels — represented by bubble size (the percentage of households without toilet access).

This visualization gives us a more complete picture of household vulnerability in Rajshahi, helping us understand how economic and infrastructural pressures shape family dynamics in both urban and rural settings.



In this next visualization, we bring in an additional dimension of poverty — the percentage of households without toilet access. This acts as a more direct proxy for poverty and sanitation-related deprivation.

```{r fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Desktop/ECNS_560_REDO/Plots/child_dependency_bubble_plot.png")
```

This bubble chart tells a more layered story about household vulnerability.

This chart shows how child dependency (how many kids each adult is supporting) changes depending on rice prices and poverty levels (measured by access to toilets).


In a Household Dataset (like IPUMS), you can approximate it as:
Child Dependency Ratio = Number of Children/Number of Working-Age Adults
 
- Where:

Children = Household members aged 0–14

Working-Age Adults = Members aged 15–64

- consistent with international demographic standards (World Bank, 2023; United Nations Population Division).



1. Urban areas have higher child dependency.
Even though we often think rural families are bigger, in this case, urban families (the blue dots) are supporting more children per adult.
That might be because:

Young families with kids are moving to cities for work.

Urban slums may have higher birth rates.

Or simply, families in cities are structured differently.

2. As rice prices go up, families have fewer dependents.
In both rural and urban areas, we see a gentle decline in child dependency as rice prices increase. This could mean that:

Higher rice prices reflect stronger local economies or rising household incomes.

Families may be choosing to have fewer children as the cost of living rises.

It might also reflect a broader shift toward smaller, more stable households.

Notably, in rural areas — where many households are directly involved in rice production — higher prices likely lead to greater income for farmers, reducing economic dependency within families.


3. Poverty seems to go down when rice prices go up.
Bubble size represents the percentage of households without toilet access — a strong poverty proxy.

Larger bubbles (more poverty) are clustered where rice is cheapest.

Smaller bubbles (less poverty) appear where rice is more expensive.

This again ties back to the idea that higher rice prices may benefit rural producers, improving income and enabling better living conditions (like improved sanitation).




*Key Insights:*
- Rural Areas (Red Bubbles):
The larger red bubbles at the lower end of the rice price range tell us that:

When rice prices are low, child dependency is a bit higher.

These areas also tend to have higher rates of poverty, as shown by the large bubble size (e.g., 30–40% without toilet access).

As rice price increases, rural bubbles shrink and shift lower on the Y-axis, suggesting that economic improvement may reduce both poverty and child dependency.

- Urban Areas (Teal Bubbles):
Urban areas generally have smaller bubbles — indicating better toilet access and lower poverty.

There's less variation in child dependency with rice prices, reinforcing earlier findings.

However, even at similar rice prices, urban bubbles tend to float higher, implying slightly higher child dependency than rural areas with comparable rice prices.



# Why Might Rising Rice Prices Reduce Poverty and Child Dependency in Rural Areas?
At first glance, it might seem counterintuitive that higher rice prices are associated with lower poverty and lower child dependency in rural areas. After all, wouldn't rising food costs hurt poor families the most?

But in rural regions of Bangladesh, especially in divisions like Rajshahi, many households are not just consumers of rice — they are also producers. Rice farming is a primary source of income in these communities.

So when rice prices rise:

Farmers earn more from selling their harvests, increasing household income.

With higher income, families may rely less on child labor or caregiving, thus reducing the child dependency ratio.

Greater financial stability may also enable families to invest in basic infrastructure — like sanitation — which is reflected in the shrinking bubble size (% without toilet access) as rice prices increase.

This helps explain why, in your bubble plot:

Larger red bubbles (indicating higher poverty) cluster around lower rice prices, and

As rice price increases, the bubbles get smaller and move lower on the Y-axis — suggesting lower poverty and fewer dependents per working-age adult.



# In the previous bubble plot, we explored how child dependency ratios interact with rice prices and poverty levels (proxied by lack of toilet access). While that gave us insight into the burden on working-age individuals in different economic and area-type contexts, it left an important piece of the puzzle unexplored:

* How does family structure itself evolve over time?

After all, child dependency doesn’t exist in a vacuum — it’s shaped by how families are composed, especially the number of children and working adults. To understand the underlying demographic dynamics that influence child dependency, we now turn to a time-based look at average family size in the Rajshahi division from 1991 to 2011.


```{r fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Desktop/ECNS_560_REDO/Plots/family_size_trend_rajshahi.png")
```

This line graph tracks how average family size has changed over time in the Rajshahi Division — separately for urban and rural areas — across three census years: 1991, 2001, and 2011.

*Interpretation:* Over the 20-year span from 1991 to 2011, average family size in Rajshahi decreased overall, hitting a low in 2001 before slightly rising by 2011. The sharp decline in the 1990s may reflect family planning, education, or economic changes. Interestingly, urban family sizes remained larger throughout, possibly reflecting different living arrangements or economic migration patterns. This trend reflects how evolving socioeconomic conditions — such as education, migration, and resource constraints — have influenced household composition across time.

This shows:

Even though cities are expected to have smaller families, urban areas had bigger households — possibly due to:

- More extended families living together,

- Or migration — young families moving to cities.


While the bubble plot captured a cross-sectional snapshot linking rice price, poverty, and child dependency, the chart below shifts the focus to temporal trends. It shows how child dependency evolved over time from 1991 to 2011 in urban and rural Rajshahi, offering insight into long-term demographic changes across different area types.

```{r fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Desktop/ECNS_560_REDO/Plots/child_dependency_over_time.png")
```

I tried to create bar graphs here. But the line plot is more intuitive, since: It visually connects 1991 → 2001 → 2011, and clearly shows the direction of change over time for both urban and rural areas.According to the graph, 

* Urban Areas (Teal):

- Started high in 1991 (~0.177)

- Peaked in 2001 (~0.181)

- Dropped by 2011 (~0.175)

* Rural Areas (Red):

- Very stable from 1991 (~0.163) to 2001 (~0.164)
- Then sharply declined by 2011 (~0.159)



**rural areas:**
- Very stable child dependency between 1991 and 2001, hovering around 0.164.

- Then a clear drop after 2001 — by 2011, it falls to under 0.159.

However, 
*urban areas:* 
- Start off higher than rural, around 0.177 in 1991.

- Peaks slightly in 2001 (above 0.181), then also declines sharply by 2011.

So, urban child dependency is consistently higher, but both urban and rural areas follow a similar arc: stable or slightly rising in the 1990s, followed by a notable decline in the 2000s.


*Interpretation:*
Between 1991 and 2011, both rural and urban areas in Rajshahi experienced a gradual decline in child dependency. Urban areas consistently had a higher child dependency ratio than rural areas — possibly due to the presence of young migrant families, higher birth rates in lower-income urban communities, or differences in household composition. The sharp decline after 2001 suggests that fertility reductions and changing economic conditions began to reshape household structures more rapidly in both contexts. This trend reflects a broader demographic shift toward smaller, economically leaner households.


Building on the time trend of child dependency, the next visualization offers a side-by-side comparison of two related demographic indicators: average family size and child dependency ratio. By faceting the trends across urban and rural areas, this plot highlights how both indicators have shifted over time and whether their trajectories align or diverge within different contexts.

Family Size vs. Child Dependency Over Time
Rajshahi Division (Urban vs. Rural | 1991–2011)

# Observations: 

*Rural Areas:*
- Family size declined from ~4.9 (1991) to ~4.3 (2001), then rose to ~4.85 (2011).

- Child dependency remained stable until 2001, then dropped notably by 2011.

* This suggests shrinking households with fewer children, followed by stabilization or extended-family structures.


*Urban Areas:*

- Family size fell from ~5.5 to under 5 by 2001, then rose to ~5.3 in 2011.

- Child dependency was consistently higher than rural, peaked in 2001, then declined.



*Interpretation:*
This combined plot highlights the demographic shift in Rajshahi from 1991 to 2011. Both urban and rural households saw declining family sizes and child dependency ratios between 1991 and 2001 — reflecting the country’s push toward smaller, more economically manageable families. Interestingly, while average family sizes rebounded slightly after 2001, child dependency continued to decline, especially in rural areas. This could point to growing adult populations or fewer births per household. Urban areas, while having larger families overall, also maintained higher child dependency, suggesting different migration and fertility dynamics across space.



### Econometric Analysis
This section presents the econometric approach used to examine how child dependency ratios in the Rajshahi Division vary with rice prices, poverty levels (proxied by toilet access), and household characteristics over time and space. My analysis is primarily descriptive and exploratory — aimed at identifying patterns rather than establishing causal relationships.



*I applied Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to both aggregated and household-level data:*

Le's model Trends Over Time:
This model tests whether the trend in child dependency differs by 

--------------------------------------------------------------

model_time <- lm(avg_child_dependency ~ YEAR * urban_rural, data = rajshahi_summary)

--------------------------------------------------------------



- This linear regression  aims to model how average child dependency changes over time, considering differences between urban and rural areas.


- While the overall model fit was strong (R² = 0.94), individual coefficients were not statistically significant due to the limited sample. The results suggest a slight downward trend in child dependency over time, with rural areas showing a marginally steeper decline than urban ones. However, these differences should be interpreted with caution, given the small number of observations.





# To expand the model with contextual variables (like poverty and family size) to better understand what might explain child dependency over time.


I am Reducing the number of predictors here because I had Too few observations: I only had 6 rows (3 years × 2 area types).



--------------------------------------------------------------

model_micro <- lm(child_dependency ~ avg_price + avg_no_toilet_pct + urban_rural + FAMSIZE, 
                  data = ipums_all_expanded)

-------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
                  
                  
Modeling Child Dependency Using Household-Level Microdata:
To address the limitations of small-sample modeling (n = 6), I expanded the analysis to the household level, using IPUMS microdata from Rajshahi across three census years (1991, 2001, and 2011). This approach allowed for a more robust statistical model by incorporating millions of individual observations, each enriched with macro-level contextual variables such as average rice price and poverty indicators (e.g., percentage of households without toilet access).

Each household was matched to its corresponding year and urban/rural status using the contextual dataset (rajshahi_contextual). A new variable was created to represent child dependency at the household level, defined as the number of children (NCHILD) divided by total household size (FAMSIZE). The final model used the following predictors: average rice price (avg_price), poverty proxy (avg_no_toilet_pct), area type (urban_rural), and household size (FAMSIZE).

The linear regression results reveal several meaningful insights:

Average rice price was negatively associated with child dependency: a one-BDT increase in rice price predicted a decrease in child dependency by approximately 0.0045 units, holding other factors constant. This suggests that higher rice prices—potentially reflecting improved rural incomes or economic growth—are associated with fewer dependents per household.

Urban households had a significantly higher child dependency ratio (by about 0.0044) compared to rural households, even after accounting for poverty and family size. This aligns with earlier findings and may reflect factors such as youth migration to cities or higher birth rates in lower-income urban communities.

Larger households tended to have higher child dependency ratios, with each additional household member increasing dependency by approximately 0.004.

Interestingly, the percentage of households without toilets showed a negative association with child dependency in this model. While this finding seems counterintuitive—since poverty is generally expected to increase dependency—it may reflect complex or nonlinear relationships at the household level that differ from aggregated patterns. Further analysis may be needed to clarify this result.

Despite the low R-squared value (0.0025), which is typical in large-scale social microdata, the model benefits from high statistical power, thanks to the large number of observations. Overall, this micro-level approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of how economic, infrastructural, and demographic factors jointly shape family structures and dependency patterns in Rajshahi.




To further explore the relationship between child dependency and rice prices, the following plot presents individual data points with adjusted positions for clarity and labeled percentages. By separating urban and rural points horizontally and adding linear trends for each group, the chart allows for a more nuanced comparison of patterns — particularly how dependency levels shift in different pricing contexts.

# let's now create plot that compares average child dependency across rice price categories, separately for urban vs. rural areas:

```{r fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, out.width='85%'}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Desktop/ECNS_560_REDO/Plots/child_dependency_vs_rice_price_nudged.png")
```
This plot looks at how child dependency (the share of children in a household compared to working-age adults) relates to the average price of rice in Rajshahi Division — split by urban and rural areas.

Each point represents a specific year (1991, 2001, 2011), with labeled percentages showing the exact child dependency ratio. Trend lines indicate how this relationship changes across the rice price spectrum.

*Rural Areas (Red):*
As rice prices rise (from ~13 to ~30 BDT), the child dependency ratio declines slightly — from ~16.4% to ~15.9%.

This suggests that in rural areas, higher food costs may coincide with smaller or more adult-heavy households.

It may reflect economic pressure: when rice is expensive, rural families might limit family size or delay childbirth.

*Urban Areas (Blue):*
Urban child dependency starts higher (up to 18.1%) and also shows a small downward trend.

Even though cities typically offer better services and access, urban households have had more children per adult historically.





*The graph explores how child dependency ratios vary in relation to average rice prices across rural and urban areas in Rajshahi Division.*

- Rural Areas:
In rural settings, the child dependency ratio shows a modest decline as rice prices rise — decreasing from 16.3% at lower price points to 15.9% at higher ones. This trend may indicate that increasing economic pressures (reflected by rising staple food prices) could lead households to reduce the number of dependents. Possible explanations include declining birth rates, delayed childbearing, or shifts in family composition in response to changing costs of living.

- Urban Areas:
A similar downward trend is visible in urban areas, though the starting point is consistently higher — from 18.2% down to 17.5%. Despite urban areas typically offering better infrastructure and services, they exhibit higher child dependency ratios overall. This may reflect inward migration of families with children seeking employment, education, or better living conditions. It could also suggest different social dynamics in urban households compared to rural ones.




***Conclusion:***
This analysis reveals that rice prices, poverty, and child dependency are deeply interconnected — and these relationships vary between rural and urban areas.

In rural Rajshahi, lower rice prices may seem like good news for consumers, but they often signal hardship for farming families. When prices drop, so do farmers’ earnings, increasing household vulnerability and limiting access to basic services like sanitation. These conditions are often linked to larger families and higher child dependency, as children may be viewed as future labor or security.

In urban areas, the story is more complex. Higher rice prices can create strain, especially for low-income households. Yet, they may also reflect broader economic shifts — rising wages, infrastructure improvements, or market growth. These shifts often align with improved sanitation, smaller families, and declining child dependency, particularly where access to education and family planning is stronger.

Across both contexts, one thing is clear:

Child dependency is not just about family size or income — it’s shaped by deeper structural factors like poverty, market dynamics, and access to services.

Understanding these patterns helps us better design policies that address vulnerability not just through food prices, but through long-term investments in livelihoods, infrastructure, and human development.

These insights suggest that targeted support for rural producers during low-price periods, alongside sanitation investment and education outreach, could reduce both poverty and child dependency. Urban interventions may need to account for migration dynamics and slum-specific conditions to be effective.
